In this work, 144 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2021 were selected. The patients were divided into a radiosensitive group (79 cases) and an insensitive group (65 cases) according to the tumor volume shrinkage during radiotherapy. The 3D Slicer 4.10.2 software was used to delineate the tumor region of interest (ROI), and a total of 1223 radiomics features were extracted using the radiomics module under the software. After between-group and within-group consistency tests, one-way ANOVA, and LASSO dimensionality reduction, three omics features were finally selected for the establishment of predictive models. At the same time, the age, gender, tumor Tstage and N stage, hemoglobin, and albumin of the patients were collected to establish a clinical prediction model. The results showed that compared with logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost models, the SVM model based on CT radiomics features had the best performance in predicting tumor regression changes during tumor radiotherapy (training group area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.840 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.764-0.916); validation group: AUC: 0.810 (95% CI: 0.676-0.944)). Compared with the supported vector machine (SVM) prediction model based on clinical features, the SVM model based on radiomics features had better performance in predicting the change of retraction during tumor radiotherapy (training group: omics feature SVM model AUC: 0.84, clinical feature SVM model: 0.78; validation group: omics feature SVM model AUC: 0.8, clinical feature SVM model: 0.58, P=0.044). Based on the radiomics characteristics and clinical characteristics of patients, a nomo prediction map was established, and the calibration curve shows good consistency, which can be visualized to assist clinical judgment. In this work, the prediction model composed of CT-based radiomic features combined with clinical features can accurately predict withdrawal changes during tumor radiotherapy, ensuring the accuracy of treatment planning, and minimizing the number of CT scans during radiotherapy.

To explore the feasibility of automatically detecting the degree of meniscus injury by radiomics fusion of dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of sagittal and coronal planes of the knee joint. Methods. This retrospective study included 164 arthroscopically confirmed meniscus injuries in 152 patients admitted to the Department of Orthopaedics of our hospital from July 2018 to March 2021. A total of 1316-dimensional radiomics signatures were extracted from single-mode sagittal and coronal plane images of menisci, respectively. Then, the sagittal and coronal plane features were fused to form a dual-mode joint feature group with a total of 2632-dimensional radiomics signatures. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select features and generate optimal radiomics signatures. The single-mode sagittal plane feature model (Model 1), single-mode coronal plane feature model (Model 2), and the combined sagittal and coronal plane feature model (Model 3) performance were tested by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Delong test. The calibration curve test was used to verify the reliability of radiomics signatures of the three models. Results. The average infra- and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the most significant 8-dimensional radiomics signatures of Model 1 and Model 2 were 0.935 (range 0.832-0.998) and 0.928 (range 0.845-0.998), respectively. All the three models had good detection performance; Model 3 had the most significant performance (the areas under the curve (AUCs) of training, and validation sets were 0.947 and 0.923, respectively), which was superior to Model 1 (AUCs of training set and validation set were 0.889 and 0.876, respectively) and Model 2 (AUCs of training set and validation set were 0.831 and 0.851, respectively). The detection probability of training and validation sets in the three models was highly consistent with the actual clinical probability. Conclusions. It is feasible to establish a model for automatic detection of meniscus damage by means of radiomics. The detection performance of the dualmode knee MRI model is better than that of any single-mode model, showing potent feature analysis ability and outstanding detection performance.

Although CT is sensitive in detecting lesions and assessing their severity, these works mainly depend on radiologists' subjective judgment, which is inefficient in case of a large-scale outbreak. This work focuses on developing a CT-based radiomics model to assess whether COVID-19 patients are in the early, progressive, severe, or absorption stages of the disease. We retrospectively analyzed the CT images of 284 COVID-19 patients. All of the patients were divided into four groups (0-3): early (n=75), progressive (n=58), severe (n=75), and absorption (n=76) groups, according to the progression of the disease and the CT features. Meanwhile, they were split randomly to training and test datasets with the fixed ratio of 7 : 3 in each category. Thirty-eight radiomic features were nominated from 1688 radiomic features after using select K-best method and the ElasticNet algorithm. On this basis, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to build this model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the diagnostic performance of various models. The precision, recall, and f1-score of the classification model of macro- and microaverage were 0.82, 0.82, 0.81, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.81 for the training dataset and 0.75, 0.73, 0.73, 0.72, 0.72, and 0.72 for the test dataset. The AUCs for groups 0, 1, 2, and 3 on the training dataset were 0.99, 0.97, 0.96, and 0.93, and the microaverage AUC was 0.97 with a macroaverage AUC of 0.97. On the test dataset, AUCs for each group were 0.97, 0.86, 0.83, and 0.89 and the microaverage AUC was 0.89 with a macroaverage AUC of 0.90. The CT-based radiomics model proved efficacious in assessing the severity of COVID-19.</p>	[Xu, Zhigao; Yang, Guoqiang; Du, Jiangfeng] Shanxi Med Univ, Coll Med Imaging, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhigao; Zhao, Lili; Wu, Jinlong; Yang, Hui] Third Peoples Hosp Datong, Dept Radiol, Datong 037008, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guoqiang; Du, Jiangfeng] Shanxi Med Univ, Dept Radiol, Hosp 1, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Ren, Ying] Henan Univ Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Xia, Yuwei; Yang, Xuhong] Huiying Med Technol Co Ltd, Room A206,B2,Dongsheng Sci & Technol Pk, Beijing 100192, Peoples R China; [Cao, Milan; Zhang, Guojiang] Third Peoples Hosp Datong, Dept Sci & Educ, Datong 037008, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Peng, Taisong; Hu, Jinfeng] Second Peoples Hosp Datong, Dept Radiol, Datong 037005, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jiafeng] Xiantao First Peoples Hosp, Dept Rehabil Med, Xiantao 433000, Hubei, Peoples R China	Shanxi Medical University; Shanxi Medical University; Henan University of Technology	Yang, GQ; Du, JF (corresponding author), Shanxi Med Univ, Coll Med Imaging, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi, Peoples R China.; Yang, GQ; Du, JF (corresponding author), Shanxi Med Univ, Dept Radiol, Hosp 1, Taiyuan 030001, Shanxi, Peoples R China.	doctor_ygq@163.com; dujf@sxmu.edu.cn	xia, yuwei/AAQ-9122-2021; Du, Jiangfeng/JCF-1162-2023; Wu, Jinlong/X-3225-2018	xu, zhigao/0000-0002-4485-8928; Ren, Ying/0000-0002-5427-5283; Yang, Guoqiang/0000-0001-8824-244X; Jiangfeng, Du/0000-0002-8533-5509	COVID-19 Prevention and Control Research Project of COVID-19 in Datong (2); Youth Project of Applied Basic Research Project of Shanxi Province [201801D221403]; Science and Technology Innovation Project of University in Shanxi Province [2019L0440, 2020L0194]	COVID-19 Prevention and Control Research Project of COVID-19 in Datong (2); Youth Project of Applied Basic Research Project of Shanxi Province; Science and Technology Innovation Project of University in Shanxi Province	AcknowledgmentsThis work was financially supported by COVID-19 Prevention and Control Research Project of COVID-19 in Datong (2), the Youth Project of Applied Basic Research Project of Shanxi Province (201801D221403), and Science and Technology Innovation Project of University in Shanxi Province (2019L0440, 2020L0194).		26	7	7	1	14	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1687-966X	1687-9678		STEM CELLS INT	Stem Cells Int.

To select the most suitable therapy plan for individuals with domestically progressed cervical cancer, robustness metrics are required to estimate their early phase. The goal of the research is to increase the effectiveness of cervical cancer patients' detection by using deep learning-based radiomics assessment of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). From March 2016 to November 2019, 125 patients with early-stage cervical cancer provided 980 dynamic X1 contrast-enhanced (X1DCE) and 850 X2 weighted imaging (X2WI) MRI images for training and testing. A convolutional neural network model was used to estimate cervical cancer state based on the specified characteristics. The X1(DCE) exhibited high discriminative outcomes than X2(WI) MRI in terms of prediction ability, as calculated by the confusion matrix assessment and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve approach. The mean maximum region under the curve of 0.95 was found using an attentive ensemble learning method that included both MRI sequencing (Sensitivity = 0.94, Specificity = 0.94, and accuracy = 0.96). Whenever compared with conventional radiomic approaches, the results show that a variety of radiomics based on deep learning might be created to help radiologists anticipate vascular invasion in patients with cervical cancer before surgery. Based on radiomics technique, it has proven to be an effective tool for estimating cervical cancer in its early stages. It would help people choose the best therapy method for them and make medical judgments.

To explore the CT radiomic features and clinical imaging features of the primary tumor in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before treatment and their predictive value for the occurrence of bone metastases. Methods. From June 2017 to June 2021, 195 patients with NSCLC who were pathologically diagnosed without any treatment in the Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Hainan Medical College were retrospectively analyzed, and they were divided into a bone metastasis group and a nonbone metastasis group. The relationship between clinical imaging features and bone metastasis in patients was analyzed by the t-test, rank sum test, and chi 2 test. At the same time, ITK software was used to extract the radiomic characteristics of the primary tumor of the patients, and the patients were randomly divided into a training group and a validation group in a ratio of 7 : 3. The training model was validated in the validation group, and the performance of the model for predicting bone metastases in NSCLC patients was verified by the ROC curve, and a multivariate logistic regression prediction model was established based on the omics parameters extracted from the best prediction model combined with clinical image features. Results. Seven features were screened from the primary tumor by LASSO to establish a model for predicting metastasis. The area under the curve was 0.82 and 0.73 in the training and validation sets. The best omics signature and univariate analysis suggested clinical imaging factors (P < 0.05) associated with bone metastases were included in multivariate binary logistic analysis to obtain clinical characteristics of the primary tumor such as gender (OR = 0.141, 95% CI: 0.022-0.919, P = 0.04), increased Cyfra21-1 (OR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.018-0.782, P = 0.027), Fe content in blood (OR = 0.774, 95% CI: 0.626-0.958, P = 0.018), CT signs such as lesion homogeneity (OR = 0.052, 95% CI: 0.006-0.419, P=0.006), pleural indentation sign (OR =0.007, 95% CI: 0.001-0.696, P=0.034), and omics characteristics glszm_Small Area High Gray Level Emphasis (OR = 0.016, 95% CI: 0.001-0.286, P= 0.005) were independent risk factors for bone metastasis in patients. Conclusion. The prediction model established based on radiomics and clinical imaging features has high predictive performance for the occurrence of bone metastasis in NSCLC patients.

Using artificial intelligence, in particular, different machine learning techniques, is a necessary step for better data exploitation. Classically, researchers in this field of radiomics have used conventional machine learning techniques (random forest, for example). More recently, deep learning, a subdomain of machine learning, has emerged. Its applications are increasing, and the results obtained so far have demonstrated their remarkable effectiveness. Several previous studies have explored the potential applications of radiomics in colorectal cancer. These potential applications can be grouped into several categories like evaluation of the reproducibility of texture data, prediction of response to treatment, prediction of the occurrence of metastases, and prediction of survival. Few studies, however, have explored the potential of radiomics in predicting recurrence-free survival. In this study, we evaluated and compared six conventional learning models and a deep learning model, based on MRI textural analysis of patients with locally advanced rectal tumours, correlated with the risk of recidivism; in traditional learning, we compared 2D image analysis models vs. 3D image analysis models, models based on a textural analysis of the tumour versus models taking into account the peritumoural environment in addition to the tumour itself. In deep learning, we built a 16-layer convolutional neural network model, driven by a 2D MRI image database comprising both the native images and the bounding box corresponding to each image.

From January 2001 to January 2016, patients with hearing impairment diagnosed as LVAS in infancy in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Children's Hospital of Fudan University were collected and divided into the stable HL group (n=29) and the fluctuating HL group (n=30). MRI images at initial diagnosis were collected, and various deep learning neural network training models were established based on PyTorch to classify and predict the two series. Vgg16_bn, vgg19_bn, and ResNet18, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fewer layers, had favorable effects for model building, with accs of 0.9, 0.8, and 0.85, respectively. ResNet50, a CNN with multiple layers and an acc of 0.54, had relatively poor effects. The GoogLeNet-trained model performed best, with an acc of 0.98. We conclude that deep learning-based radiomics can assist doctors in accurately predicting LVAS patients to classify them into either fluctuating or stable HL types and adopt differentiated treatment methods.

To evaluate the diagnostic value of multimodal MRI radiomics based on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging (T2WI-FLAIR) combined with T1-weighted contrast enhanced imaging (T1WI-CE) in the early differentiation of high-grade glioma recurrence from pseudoprogression. Methods. A total of one hundred eighteen patients with brain gliomas who were diagnosed from March 2014 to April 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the clinical characteristics, the patients were randomly split into a training group (n=83) and a test group (n=35) at a 7 : 3 ratio. The region of interest (ROI) was delineated, and 2632 radiomic features were extracted. We used multiple logistic regression to establish a classification model, including the T1 model, T2 model, and T1+T2 model, to differentiate recurrence from pseudoprogression. The diagnostic efficiency of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy (ACC) and by analyzing the calibration curve of the nomogram and decision curve. Results. There were 75 cases of recurrence and 43 cases of pseudoprogression. The diagnostic efficacies of the multimodal MRI-based radiomic model were relatively high. The AUC values and ACC of the training group were 0.831 and 77.11%, respectively, and the AUC values and ACC of the test group were 0.829 and 88.57%, respectively. The calibration curve of the nomogram showed that the discrimination probability was consistent with the actual occurrence in the training group, and the discrimination probability was roughly the same as the actual occurrence in the test group. In the decision curve analysis, the T1+T2 model showed greater overall net efficiency. Conclusion. The multimodal MRI radiomic model has relatively high efficiency in the early differentiation of recurrence from pseudoprogression, and it could be helpful for clinicians in devising correct treatment plans so that patients can be treated in a timely and accurate manner.

Early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high recurrence rate after surgery and lacks reliable predictive tools. We explored the potential of combining enhanced CT with gut microbiome to develop a predictive model for recurrence after early HCC surgery. Methods. A total of 112 patients with early HCC who underwent hepatectomy from September 2018 to December 2020 were included in this study, and the machine learning method was divided into a training group (N=71) and a test group (N=41) with the observed endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS). Features were extracted from the arterial and portal phases of enhanced computed tomography (CT) images and gut microbiome, and features with minimum absolute contraction and selection operator regression were created, and the extracted features were scored to create a preoperative prediction model by using the multivariate Cox regression analysis with risk stratification analysis. Results. In the study cohort, the model constructed by combining radiological and gut flora features provided good predictive performance (C index, 0.811 (0.650-0.972)). The combined radiology and gut flora-based model constructed risk strata with high, intermediate, or low risk of recurrence and different characteristics of recurrent tumor imaging and gut flora. Recurrence of early stage hepatocellular carcinoma may be associated with oxidative stress in the intestinal flora. Conclusions. This study successfully constructs a risk model integrating enhanced CT and gut microbiome characteristics that can be used for the risk of postoperative recurrence in patients with early HCC. In addition, intestinal flora associated with HCC recurrence may be involved in oxidative stress.
